# Quantum Information

[Course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/home?id=239410), given by James Wootton of IBM Research.

The course begins on 19th Feb 2019 and will have weekly lectures and exercises. If you are not able to attend the course in person, you can follow along with the materials below.

## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of communication and information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, with excercises using Qiskit and IBM's 5 qubit quantum processor.

## Course Text

The course will be based on educational materials created by IBM. In particular:

* [Learning Qiskit for developers](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/developers/)
* [Quantum Composer User Guide](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/)
* [Qiskit Tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/index.ipynb)
* [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/)

## Lectures

* Lecture 1: Based on [The atoms of computation](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/getting-started-with-the-composer/chapter-1-the-atoms-of-computation) and [The unique properties of qubits](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/getting-started-with-the-composer/chapter-2-the-unique-properties-of-qubits). A Qiskit implemementation of the latter in [this notebook](Lecture1.ipynb)

* Lecture 2: For the next few weeks we'll look at how quantum states and gates can be represented, both visually and mathematically. To start this off is [this interactive exercise](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quantumjim/qiskit-tutorials/master?filepath=community%2Fgames%2FHello_Qiskit.ipynb).

* Lecture 3: Based on [Getting to know your qubits](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-the-qubit/getting-to-know-your-qubits).
