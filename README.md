# Quantum Information

[Course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/home?id=239410), given by James Wootton of IBM Research.

The course begins on 19th Feb 2019 and will have weekly lectures and exercises. If you are not able to attend the course in person, you can follow along with the materials below.

## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of communication and information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, with excercises using Qiskit and IBM's 5 qubit quantum processor.

## Course Text

The course will be based on educational materials created by IBM. In particular:

* [Quantum Composer User Guide](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/)
* [Qiskit Tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/index.ipynb)
* [Learning Qiskit for developers](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/developers/)
* [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/)

## Lectures

* Lecture 1: Based on [The atoms of computation](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/getting-started-with-the-composer/chapter-1-the-atoms-of-computation) and [The unique properties of qubits](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/getting-started-with-the-composer/chapter-2-the-unique-properties-of-qubits). A Qiskit implemementation of the latter in [this notebook](Lecture1.ipynb)

* Lecture 2: For the next few weeks we'll look at how quantum states and gates can be represented, both visually and mathematically. To start this off is [this interactive exercise](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quantumjim/qiskit-tutorials/master?filepath=community%2Fgames%2FHello_Qiskit.ipynb).

* Lecture 3: Based on [The weird and wonderful world of the qubit](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-the-qubit).

* Lecture 4: Based on [Universality of quantum computation](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/universality-of-quantum-computation).

* Lecture 5: Finishing off the above, and then moving on to [Putting gates to use](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/putting-gates-to-use).

* Lecture 6: Mixed states and quantum noise. Based on [these lecture notes](Lecture6_Quantum_Noise.pdf).

* Lecture 7: Introduction to QEC. Based on [this slideshow](Lecture7_QEC.pdf).

* Lecture 8: This week we start on quantum algorithms with the QFT and phase estimation. Based on [these lecture notes](Lecture8_Quantum_Algorithms.pdf).

* Lecture 9: Building on last week we show how to do a classical subroutine on a quantum computer and use it in Shor's algorithm. Based on [these lecture notes](Lecture9_MoreQuantum_Algorithms.pdf).

* Lecture 10: Some background on entanglement and its uses, drawing from the lecture notes [here](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/Lecture10_Quantum_Correlations_part_1.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/Lecture10_Quantum_Correlations_part_2.pdf), and the articles [Entanglement and Bell tests](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/putting-gates-to-use/entanglement-and-bell-tests) and [GHZ states](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/putting-gates-to-use/ghz-states)

* Lecture 11: Grover's search algorithm. Some of the resources this is based on are not yet available, but there great explanations on the Quantum Computing Stack Exchange [here](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/1385/is-there-a-laymans-explanation-for-why-grovers-algorithm-works/1386#1386), [here](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4397/why-does-grovers-search-invert-about-the-mean) and [here](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/5293/grover-operator-as-a-rotation-matrix).
