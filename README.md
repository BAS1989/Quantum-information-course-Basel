# Quantum Information

[Course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/home?id=239410), given by James Wootton of IBM Research.

The course begins on 19th Feb 2020 and will have weekly lectures and exercises. If you are not able to attend the course in person, you can follow along with the materials below.

## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, via the open-source Qiskit framework for quantum computing;

## Course Text

The course will be based on the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).

## Lectures

* Lecture 1: Based on [1.2 The atoms of computation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/atoms-computation.ipynb) and [1.3 The unique properties of qubits](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/unique-properties-qubits.ipynb).

## Exercises

Some exercises will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These can be run locally by installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). They can also be run online without any installation using the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter/). For this, just use the 'import' function.

The easiest way to to download the exercises is to download the whole repository using [this link](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/archive/master.zip).

* Exercise 1: Work through [this notebook](exercises/Hello_Qiskit.ipynb). Note that [this file](exercises/hello_quantum.py) needs to be located in the same directory. If using the IBM Quantum Experience, simply upload both. Hand in the completed notebook by email.


## Exam

The final exam is planned for the week of 25th May.
